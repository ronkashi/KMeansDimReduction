# KMeansDimReduction

This project is part of the course "Sketching Methods for Matrix and Data Analysis" by [Haim Evron](http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~haimav/index.html)

The objective of the project is reproducing the results of the paper [Randomized Dimensionality Reduction
for k-Means Clustering](https://www.boutsidis.org/Boutsidis_IEEE_IT_15.pdf)

## How to use

For help you can use the ```-h``` command line argument

```bash
python3 main.py -h
```

For configuring data set use (in the following example the synthetic data set)

```bash
python3 main.py --data-set SYNTH
```
